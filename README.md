# GAMS Model Instance Inspector (MII)

GAMS Model Instance Inspector (MII) is a system to examine the structure and properties of a model instance generated by the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). It is strongly inspired by the tool [GAMSCHK](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/S_GAMSCHK.html) developed by [Bruce McCarl](https://agecon.tamu.edu/people/mccarl-bruce/). For further information about GAMS please visit [GAMS](https://www.gams.com) or the [GAMS documentation](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/).

## How To Get Started

Before the MII is downloaded and installed please make sure that GAMS is installed. Details on how to install GAMS can be found on the [download page](https://www.gams.com/download/).

First download the latest version from the release page at [GitHub](https://github.com/GAMS-dev/gams-mii/releases).

Secondly install the MII on your system. Our recommendations are...

- **Windows**
  - Extract the archive and move the MII directory to your prefered location.
  - Navigate into the directory and run the `mii.exe`
- **Linux**
  - Move the AppImage to your prefered location
  - Make the AppImage executable: `chmod +x GAMS_MII-0.2.2-x86_64.AppImage`
  - Run the MII: `./GAMS_MII-0.2.2-x86_64.AppImage`
- **macOS**
  - Open the dmg, e.g. `GAMS_MII-0.2.2-x86_64.dmg`
  - Run the MII by double clicking on the MII icon

## How to use

There are two ways to use the MII to inspect a model instance:

1. Select the `.gms` file to execute in the MII and hit the `Run` button.
   - This will run the selected `.gms` file with some required command line parameter and the data of the **last** model instance in that file will be openend for inspection.
2. Select a [scratch directory](https://www.gams.com/44/docs/UG_GamsCall.html#GAMSAOscrdir) of a model that was executed already and hit the `Run` button.
   - This does not run the model again but just opens the given data for inspection.
   - The easiest way to generate such scratch directory is to execute a `.gms` file with the command line parameter [MIIMode](https://www.gams.com/44/docs/UG_GamsCall.html#GAMSAOmiimode).

# How to build

## 1. Download and install Qt ##

The recommended way to get Qt is via its official [Qt online installer](https://www.qt.io/).
If you are interested in the Qt sources you can download them through the 
installer or build Qt from scratch by following the [Qt documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/build-sources.html).
Alternatively, you can get and build Qt from the official [Qt GitHub mirror](https://github.com/qt/qt5).

## 2. Download and install GAMS ##

The GAMS Model Instance Inspector requires the GAMS low-level APIs. All those files are provided by the GAMS distribution packages, which are available for all major platforms. The installation package for your platform can be obtained from the [GAMS download page](https://www.gams.com/download/). After downloading the package please follow the latest GAMS [installation instructions](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_MAIN.html#UG_INSTALL).

**Note** By default GAMS will run in demo mode. Please check the [download page](https://www.gams.com/download/) for further details.

## 3. Get the GAMS Model Instance Inspector source code ##

Download the GAMS Model Instance Inspector sources from GitHub (via git or as zip archive). All information about the usage of this program can be found within the [GAMS Documentation](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/T_MAIN.html).

## 4. Building the GAMS Model Instance Inspector project ##

Start Qt Creator, open the project file `model-inspector.pro` and click `Build -> Run qmake`. This generates the file `gamsinclude.pri` that defines the default location of the GAMS installation location. The path within the `gamsinclude.pri` may have to be updated to the correct GAMS installation location on your system.

On Windows the file contains:
```
GAMS_DISTRIB=C:/GAMS/44
GAMS_DISTRIB_C_API=$$GAMS_DISTRIB/apifiles/C/api
GAMS_DISTRIB_CPP_API=$$GAMS_DISTRIB/apifiles/C++/api
```
On Unix it will look like:
```
GAMS_DISTRIB=$$(HOME)/gams/gams44.0_linux_x64_64_sfx
GAMS_DISTRIB_C_API=$$GAMS_DISTRIB/apifiles/C/api
GAMS_DISTRIB_CPP_API=$$GAMS_DISTRIB/apifiles/C++/api
```

Then perform a `Build All` operation (`Build -> Build All`) to build the project. Finally, the GAMS Model Instance Inspector can be executed by triggering `Run` button or pressing `Ctrl + R`.
